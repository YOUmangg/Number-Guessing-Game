# Number Guessing Game
 Used Python to create an interactive game, which can be played on the terminal. 

# Description of the game
 Enter 2 numbers, say a and b. The computer will select a number in between these two numbers, inclusive of the numbers [a, b]. The computer calculates the number of attempts you should take optimally to guess the number. 
 For each guess, the computer will tell you if your guess is less than or greater than the number it has selected. You win if you are able to guess the number in the given chances, and you lose otherwise!
